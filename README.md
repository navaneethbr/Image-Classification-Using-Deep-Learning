# Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
In this notebook, we will classify small images cifar10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets. 
There are total 10 classes as shown below. We will use CNN for classification<br>
We are having 50000 training images and 10000 test images<br>
Have use 2 convolution layers and 1 dense layer<br>
With CNN, at the end 5 epochs, accuracy was at around 70% which is a significant improvement over ANN. 
CNN's are best for image classification and gives superb accuracy. 
Also computation is much less compared to simple ANN as maxpooling reduces the image dimensions while still preserving the features
